# Project 3 - Twitter
Twitter is a basic twitter app to read your tweets.

## Overview
In Unit's 1 & 2, you fetched movie data from the Movie Database API and rendered it in a scrolling list that allowed users to tap a movie to get more details.
One thing to note is that your user did not have to sign in because they were not accessing any personal data.
In this unit, we'll be building the first part of a Twitter app that allows users to log in to their actual Twitter accounts to view their timeline tweets.
We'll use many of the same concepts you learned in Flix, making network requests and rendering data in table views.
But as you can imagine, we wouldn't want just anyone to log into our Twitter account, so this time we'll need to add a login flow that authenticates with Twitter to prove we are indeed the user we say we are.
